## Context

The Weather App requires a database to store user preferences.
The choice of database will impact the application's performance, scalability, and ease of development.
 - Support for migrations
 - Good Go ecosystem support
 - Ability to run locally and in production
 - Good performance and scalability

## Solution

### Options Considered
- **PostgreSQL**
- **SQLite**
- **MySQL**

### Evaluation

**PostgreSQL**: 
- Pros: 
  - Strong support for migrations.
  - Excellent Go ecosystem support with libraries like `pgx` and `gorm`.
  - Good performance and scalability.
- Cons: 
  - Requires a running server, which can complicate local development.

**SQLite**:
- Pros: 
  - Lightweight and easy to set up.
  - No server required, making it ideal for local development.
  - Good support in Go.
- Cons:
  - Limited scalability for production use.
  - Less robust migration support compared to PostgreSQL.

**MySQL**:
- Pros:
  - Good performance and scalability.
  - Strong community support.
- Cons:
  - More complex setup for local development.
  - Less Go ecosystem support compared to PostgreSQL.
  - Fewer advanced data types, weaker JSON support

## Decision
After evaluating the options, we chose **PostgreSQL** accessed via GORM.

- **ACID & Features:** Strong transactional guarantees.
- **Migrations:** Excellent support for migrations.
- **Go Integration:** Mature driver and ORM support.
- **Hosting:** Easily deployed in Docker/ Railway.

## Consequences

**Positive**:
- Strong transactional guarantees and data integrity
- Advanced features (JSONB, full-text search)
- Seamless integration with Go through mature drivers
- Scalable for future growth

**Negative**:
- Additional operational overhead to run and maintain a PostgreSQL service
- Potential complexity in connection-pool tuning
